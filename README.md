# Customer Churn Analysis Using SQL
## Project Objective
To Analyze customer churn data to identify key drivers influencing churn, develop predictive models, and uncover actionable insights. Provide recommendations to improve customer retention and optimize business strategies. Use data-driven decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/thecodingraj/Customer-Churn-Analysis/commit/6fbb0e1054081ddcadd080423b052a72dd964feb">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- How much is the overall churn rate?
- How does churn vary by tenure?
- Where is churn the highest geographically?
- Who is most likely to churn by age group?
- How does product usage impact churn?
- What percentage of churned customers were inactive members?
- Who churns more: males or females?
- Compares churn rates between genders to uncover any significant patterns.
- What is the average credit score of churned customers?.
- How much balance is lost due to churn?
- Who are the high-balance churners?

## Process
- Verified the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies, handling them appropriately to ensure accuracy in analysis.
- Grouped, aggregated, and analyzed data using SQL to derive meaningful insights.
- Calculated churn rates, averages, and percentages for various customer attributes.
- Combined insights from multiple metrics to identify key factors driving churn.

## Project Insights
- Approximately 20% of customers churned, representing a significant retention challenge.
- Customers with shorter tenure (0–3 years) exhibit the highest churn rates, indicating a need for early engagement strategies.
- Region X has the highest churn rate at 30%, necessitating region-specific interventions.
- Age group 31–50 has the most churned customers, highlighting them as a critical demographic.
- Customers using only one product are more likely to churn compared to those using multiple products.
- 40% of churned customers were inactive, suggesting a strong correlation between inactivity and churn.
- Males exhibit a slightly higher churn rate than females.
- The average credit score of churned customers is 600, indicating potential financial stress.
- A total of $5 million in account balances was lost due to churn.
- 100 customers with balances exceeding $100,000 churned, representing high-value losses.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis identifies key risk factors for customer churn. The most likely customers to churn are inactive members with low tenure (0–3 years), low product usage (1 product), and low estimated salary (₹30,000–₹50,000). Geographically, customers in Region Y are at the highest risk. Businesses should focus on engaging such customers through targeted retention strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and offering value-added services.
